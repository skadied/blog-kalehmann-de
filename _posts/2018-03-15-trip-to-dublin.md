# Let's go to Ireland

In the march of 2018 I spontaneous decided to travel for four days to Dublin,
Ireland and visit my cousin there.

Since the tight planning, I booked my flight 4 days before I left. I started in
Dresden, had a short layover in Cologne and then flew directly to Dublin.

Cologne out of the plane:

On the day of the arrival I just walked a little bit around the city, talked
to some nice people and explored the nightlife and pubs of Dublin.

On the next day we traveled together to Howth in the north of Dublin. It was a
little bit foggy and rainy but nevertheless a nice trip.

At the third day we made a small trip to the sea front of Greystones in the
south of Dublin. From there we wandered back to Dublin.

On our way we also came across the Bray Head hill.

Dinner and Lunch have been nice experiences everyday, since we always visted a
pub.

On my last day in Dublin I explored the city again and left in the evening.
Just as on the outbound flight I had a layover in Cologne.
